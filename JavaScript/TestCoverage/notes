- Line code coverage does not guarantee anything
- Avoid false confidence in tests
- Don't be decieved by beatiful code coverage metric values
- A lot depends on the quality of tests
- Scenario coverage is more difficult to estimate
- Always possible to add a new test for discovered new input
- Often difficult to cover all the inputs
- Some leap of faith in the code is still needed
- No exact recipe when we have written enough tests, not too many not too few
- Write just enough tests so that the code works in scenarios for which you feel it may be broken
and may scenarios
- For strictly proving that your code is correct a whole different approach is needed, in some cases it is really needed
- Avoid introducing extra scenarios into testing by not being speculatively generic
- Maybe fine for external libraries, but for own code think twice, again a gut feeling, no exact recipe
