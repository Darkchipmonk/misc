- Draw pendulum - DONE
- Pendulum moves but not according to physics laws - DONE
- Implement physics laws for pendulum movement with hard-coded initial values - DONE
- Re-factor the code: extract simulation parts, Physics parts etc. - DONE
- Initial values can be customized - DONE
  -- Pi value can be specified as 'pi'
  -- Add validation for inputs
  -- If friction is 100 then pendulum should not visibly move
