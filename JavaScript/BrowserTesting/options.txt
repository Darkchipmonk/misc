- PhantomJS 1.9.8 http://phantomjs.org/
- CasperJS http://casperjs.org/

- DalekJS http://dalekjs.com/


Evaluation plan:

- Browser support, how many browsers can be tested?
- Availability of high level API/rich API to code scenarios


PhantomJS:

quite low level API, is supposed to be used by other tools rather than directly, no visibility at what stage the browser is
constant switching between the context of the browser and the current page, not clear in which context the current code is being executed

Overall: better not to use directly, unless a script is very simple, otherwise consider using other tools
