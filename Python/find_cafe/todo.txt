Code the following decision rules:

#TODO: If one cafe one day then likely another one next day
#TODO: If meatballs, likely go there
#TODO: Prefer meat
#TODO: Chicken is also OK but worse
#TODO: Fish is sort of OK, but worse than chicken
#TODO: If pea soup, likely go there
#TODO: If bad weather (strong wind or high probability of rain) then Hima & Sali
#TODO: If Wednesday or Friday the possibility of Nepalese is greater
#TODO: No menu means no way to go to that cafe (holiday)
